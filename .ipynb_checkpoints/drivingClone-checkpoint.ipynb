    "# Behavior Cloning Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals / steps of this project are the following:\n",
    "* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior\n",
    "* Build, a convolution neural network in Keras that predicts steering angles from images\n",
    "* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set\n",
    "* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road\n",
    "* Summarize the results with a written report\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulator can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim \n",
    "https://github.com/endymioncheung/CarND-MacCatalinaSimulator (macOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collecting Training Data\n",
    "In order to start collecting training data, you'll need to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Enter Training Mode in the simulator.\n",
    "2. Start driving the car to get a feel for the controls.\n",
    "3. When you are ready, hit the record button in the top right to start recording.\n",
    "4. Continue driving for a few laps or till you feel like you have enough data.\n",
    "5. Hit the record button in the top right again to stop recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategies for Collecting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "    the car should stay in the center of the road as much as possible\n",
    "    if the car veers off to the side, it should recover back to center\n",
    "    driving counter-clockwise can help the model generalize\n",
    "    flipping the images is a quick way to augment the data\n",
    "    collecting data from the second track can also help generalize the model\n",
    "    we want to avoid overfitting or underfitting when training the model\n",
    "    knowing when to stop collecting more data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data will be saved from the recorder as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. IMG folder - this folder contains all the frames of your driving.\n",
    "2. driving_log.csv - each row in this sheet correlates your image with the steering angle, throttle, brake, and speed of your car. You'll mainly be using the steering angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training The Network\n",
    "\n",
    "I will use Keras to train a network to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take in an image from the center camera of the car. This is the input to your neural network.\n",
    "2. Output a new steering angle for the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following network will be used to verify that everything is working properly and will be a flattened image connected to a single output node. \n",
    "This single output node will predict my steering angle, which makes this a regression network and no activation function will be applied. \n",
    "This will try to minimize the error that the network predicts and the ground truth steering measurement"

    "## Multiple Cameras\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real car, we’ll have multiple cameras on the vehicle, and we’ll map recovery paths from each camera. For example, if you train the model to associate a given image from the center camera with a left turn, then you could also train the model to associate the corresponding image from the left camera with a somewhat softer left turn. And you could train the model to associate the corresponding image from the right camera with an even harder left turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that way, you can simulate your vehicle being in different positions, somewhat further off the center line. To read more about this approach, see this paper by NVIDIA: http://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of How Multiple Cameras Work\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of the left camera, the steering angle would be less than the steering angle from the center camera. From the right camera's perspective, the steering angle would be larger than the angle from the center camera. The next section will discuss how this can be implemented in your project although there is no requirement to use the left and right camera images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Cameras in This Project\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, recording recoveries from the sides of the road back to center is effective. But it is also possible to use all three camera images to train the model. When recording, the simulator will simultaneously save an image for the left, center and right cameras. Each row of the csv log file, driving_log.csv, contains the file path for each camera as well as information about the steering measurement, throttle, brake and speed of the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, I want to feed the left and right camera images to your model as if they were coming from the center camera. This way, you can teach your model how to steer if the car drifts off to the left or the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figuring out how much to add or subtract from the center angle will involve some experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "During prediction (i.e. \"autonomous mode\"), you only need to predict with the center camera image.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary to use the left and right images to derive a successful model. Recording recovery driving from the sides of the road is also effective.\n"

Be sure to randomly shuffle the data before splitting into training and validation sets.\n",
